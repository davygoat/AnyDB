- Add Database.BeginTransaction() overloads to mirror Database constructor.

- Possibly add Database shortcut methods to Transaction, e.g. tx.GetScalar<int>(). Or is that too much hassle for /// comments?

- Database(DbConnectStringBuilder) constructor. AnyDB connection string builder with standard properties that "knows" 
  what keywords to use for the target database?

- Properly re-test all databases.

- Testing with LOOPIT show SQLite regularly pauses.

- MySQL JDBC needs allowMultiQueries=true for semicolon batches. Do other databases have similar query string options?

- Informix seems to leak handles on Exception. But it keeps on going, well over 50000 handles... Will it eventually 
  run out of handles or has it just got an insanely large pool?

- Put pre-driver hacks, i.e. ODBC, DB2, Oracle, into drivers. More custom attributes for query string rewriting?

- LIMIT ... OFFSET ...

- Rdb testing. Create AnyDB tables and procedures on PSMET?

- CUBRID: Java stored procedures.

- Sybase ASE, SQL Anywhere.
- Ingres.
- Cassandra.
- Derby, HSQLDB and other Java/JDBC using IKVM.NET? (Also for CUBRID?) http://www.ikvm.net/
- H2 using h2sharp. Also try PostgreSQL ODBC driver.

- Check procedures with same name in different schemas. Make sure parameters don't get mixed up together.

- Check Excel with $ and cell ranges in table name (must be in square brackets), at least to include in documentation.

- All databases should also work with their ODBC drivers. Make sure they do.

- Documentation: User Guide.

- Do traditional parameter markers still work with the query rewriter? Check if out of sequence parameter markers work 
  when parameters are named. They should. But naming parameters also creates problems with different RDMBS "parameter 
  marker format string". In that case, I might have to rewrite the parameters.

- INOUT parameters
- Check NULL handling
- BLOBS and CLOBS
- XML data: can SQL Server XML column be read into an XmlDocument or an object?

- Rewrite Gipoulateur to use AnyDB.

- The Amalgamated Union of Gnomes, Undines and Goblins.
- The Sylphs' and Salamanders' Igneous Miasmateers Association.
